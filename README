I want to learn C. And so I'm going to make several projects from scratch to teach me.
Description of projects:
Login
    The goal here is to make a simple login system where
    every user has their own file
    Status: segfaults galore
Library Catalog
    This uses a single file for the catalog of a library
    Books are stored with their names, author, number in
    stock, and a unique id
    Status: Adding books works, as well as searching by 
    id
